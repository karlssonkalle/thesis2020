# thesis2020
This repository contains codes used for my thesis at the Swedish school of library and information science (SSLIS). 
I used Python 3.8. The codes consists of the following parts: 

## Unpaywall: 
Code used to query the Unpaywall API and obtain OA status (bronze, gold, green, hybrid, non-OA) 

# Altmetric.com
Code used to query the Altmetric.com API and retrieve mentions in news media. 

# Topic modeling
Code used for topic modeling of 70, 206 abstracts on climate action (SDG13). 
I used the topic model by Sklearn and NLTK/Gensim for data cleaning and LDAvis for visualization of the model. 

# Plots
I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create scatterplots.
